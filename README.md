# Sprint-4-project
Project Overview
Welcome to the Car Database Analysis Project! This project explores a comprehensive dataset of vehicles with various specifications. Everything in this project can be found in the *_sprint-4-venv_* Below is a brief guide to help you navigate through the project's components:

_Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Statistical Data Analysis (SDA)_:

All the exploratory and statistical analysis of the data are documented in the *_notebooks_* folder named *_EDA.ipynb_*, located in the notebooks folder.
Streamlit Application:

The app, *_app.py_*, can be found in the *_Scripts_* folder. This app allows users to filter and explore the car data interactively, offering various visualizations to help you find a vehicle that suits your budget and preferences.

_Filtering and Visualization_:

In the app, you can filter the dataframe based on criteria such as the car's condition, fuel type, model year, number of cylinders, and whether it has four-wheel drive. The visualizations included in the app provide insights to assist in making informed decisions.

_Dependencies_:

All required packages for this project are listed in the requirements.txt file located in the root directory of the project.

_Description_:

The app is a car analysis app that allows users to explore a dataset of vehicles by applying various filters such as model year, condition, fuel type, number of cylinders, and four-wheel drive status. Users can visualize the filtered data through interactive plots, such as average price by condition or price vs. mileage. The app provides a sidebar for selecting filters and visualizations, updating the displayed results in real-time based on user choices. The app is built using Streamlit and Plotly Express, providing an intuitive interface for analyzing and understanding vehicle data.
